# FastAPI

1. Write a main.py script
2. Use the command the to run the main.py file: 'uvicorn main:app --reload' (what it does is, it reloads the page when made some changes in the file)
3. You'll be given a link (http://127.0.0.1:8000). Now you can use this key as well: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs will redirect you the Swagger UI
4. That's where you'll find all your requests

### We use:
- __POST__: to create the data
- __GET__: to read the data
- __PUT__: to update the data
- __DELETE__: to delete the data

### What is PyDantic
- It's the parsing library
- Simplifies the data type (basically you can assign the datatype while receiving the input)

NOTE: ALMOST ANYTHING CAN BE VIEWED OR TESTED ON THE SWAGGER UI, NOT NECESSARILY HAS TO BE POSTMAN
